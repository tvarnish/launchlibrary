The wonderful Launch Library API that this wrapper is based on was designed by Pete Riesett and Benjamin Higginbotham, and run with the support of the Launch Librarians (see https://launchlibrary.net/about.html for a list of all of the project's volunteers.)

This Python wrapper was designed and implemented by Thomas Varnish (https://github.com/tvarnish).
