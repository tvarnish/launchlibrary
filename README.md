# launchlibrary
A Python wrapper for the wonderful Launch Library API (see https://launchlibrary.net/ for further details)

## What can I do with the Launch Library API?
The [Launch Library API](https://launchlibrary.net/), is a "repository of rocket launch information". You can fetch information about upcoming launches, rockets, missions, and launch locations/pads.

## Acknowledgements
The Launch Library API that this wrapper is based on was designed by Pete Riesett and Benjamin Higginbotham, and run with the support of the Launch Librarians (see https://launchlibrary.net/about.html for a list of all of the project's volunteers.)

This Python wrapper was designed and implemented by Thomas Varnish (https://github.com/tvarnish).
